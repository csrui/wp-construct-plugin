# WP CLI

We want to add a few commands for WP CLI to aid with day to day work.

## IDEAS

* Version bumping when updating your plugin code
* Generators
  * Post Types
  * Taxonomies
  * Fields
  * Fixtures
  * Migrations

For now you can start using the super useful

```bash
wp banana
```

## Commands Available

### Generator

Generate a random identifier to use on ACF Groups and Fields.

```bash
wp generator acf_identifier
```
